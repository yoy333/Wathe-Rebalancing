------------------------------------------------------
The Last Voyage of the Harpy Express 1.2 - 1.21.1
------------------------------------------------------
- Completely rewrote the game logic to now use a new API GameMode class, allowing for moddable new game modes with custom default start times, minimum player counts, initialization and finalization methods, and client and server game loop ticking
- Changed the Role record into a class for better custom extendability and added new role variables to allow more precise role customization:
  - moodType: Allows to set whether the mood is functional, fake (like killers), or non-functional
  - maxSprintTime: The max sprint time that a role can sprint for
  - canSeeTime: Whether a role can see the time left before the end of the game
- Discovery mode now requires 1+ player to be boarded to start, and loose ends requires 2+
- /start now uses the identifier of the game mode you want to start and will suggest other game modes if they are registered / added via add-ons
- Made the /start command available for everyone, restricting only Discovery and Loose Ends game modes start commands to supporters
- Removed Sprinkler ambience as it would be unreliably playing with sound physics remastered and potentially cause performance issues
